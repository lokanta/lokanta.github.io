**Remembering the Buddhaâ€™s teachings, one drop at a time.**

Buddhists are the world experts in remembering things. We maintained our scriptures in memory for hundreds of years! 

Each Sutta begins with by recording the time, the place, and the person. This helps memory by connecting a teaching to a specific set of circumstances. Why not use the same technique today to lock the teachings into memory?

## What is a Dhamma Drop?

A 50 minute session for learning and practicing the Dhamma. By focusing on one short passage at a time, you will carry that memory of that specific teaching.

- 5 minutes introduction
- 20 minutes teaching
- 20 minutes meditation
- 5 minutes reflection

## What makes it special?

Each participant gets a beautiful postcard which has:

- An image of a specific Dhamma teaching
- The text with reference
- Space to record details and reflections

Like this!

After hearing the teaching, you meditate, giving the teachings the chance to settle deeper into your mind. Then, at the end of the session, you write down the time, the place, and a person who was present. These details anchor the teachings to a specific event. Then you put down a few words reflecting on what you learned in that session. 

Keep the postcard as a message to your future self: remember this! 

Take it home, put it on your fridge, or keep it by your bed or your shrine, and remind yourself from time to time: this is what I have learned.
