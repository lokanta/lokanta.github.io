<p class="lead">Bhante Sujato and Bhante Akāliko live at Lokanta Vihara, the “Monastery at the End of the World”. The vihara is located on the lands of the traditional owners, the Burramattagal people of the Darug nation, in Harris Park, Sydney. We pay our respects to Darug elders past, present, and emerging. At Lokanta Vihara, we explore what it means to follow the Buddha’s teachings in an era of climate change, globalised consumerism, and political turmoil.</p>

<h2>Journey to the Symbiocene</h2>
<p> The symbiocene is a concept that describes how humans can live with mutual benefit (or symbiosis) with the earth and each other. Bhante Akaliko explores the symbiocene through the experience of walking the Buddhist path, which offers many opportunities to become mindful of our actions, practice contentment and live harmoniously.</p>

<h2>Visualising the Path: Ethics, Generosity & Mental Development</h2>
<p>Bhante Akāliko joins the Malaysian based Maha Satipatthana Buddhist Society, Klang,
for this special online workshop exploring the highly visual world of the suttas. The Buddha encouraged the lay community to develop ethical conduct, generosity and to develop their minds through meditation. This session explores the rich repertoire of similes the Buddha used in his teaching to help his audience understand these concepts and practice them in daily life.</p>

<h1>Who are we?</h1>

<p>Bhantes Sujato and Akāliko are Australian Buddhist monks, ordained in the Thai lineage of Theravada Buddhism.</p>

<ul><li>Bhante Sujato is a senior teaching monk in Australia and the region. He is currently focussing on leading the team for <a href="https://suttacentral.net/" title="Go to suttacentral">SuttaCentral</a>, a website for early Buddhist texts, translations, and parallels.

<li>Bhante Akāliko is a long term student of Bhante Sujato. He took ordination with Ajahn Brahm in Bodhinyana Monastery, Perth. He is the founder of <a href="https://rainbodhi.org/">Rainbodhi LGBTQIA+ Buddhist Community</a>. He is a Buddhist chaplain at Western Sydney University and on the Board of Directors of the Buddhist Council of NSW.</ul>

<p>At the Monastery at the End of the World we try to be simple, frugal, and content. The little we have is second-hand where possible; either donated or rescued from cast-offs. We rely on the kindness of others, going on alms-round (<i>piṇḍapāta</i>) in our local community for our only meal of the day.</p>

<p>The monks offer an ongoing series of talks and events that will challenge and inspire you to think in new ways about your Dhamma practice. </p>

<h1 id='pindapata'>Almsround and House Dana Invitations</h1>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lokanta/lokanta.github.io/master/pindapata.jpg" alt="Photo of Bhante Sujato and Bhante Akaliko on almsround in Harris Park.">

<h3>Piṇḍapāta</h3>
<p> On weekdays, the monks walk for alms-food in the local area (<i>piṇḍapāta</i>). Come along and put some food in the monks’ bowls!</p> 
<p><b>Monday to Fridays only. Corner of Wigram and Marion streets, Harris Park, outside the Post Office around 11:00am.</b></p>

<p>Almsround is a tradition that dates back to the time of the Buddha. <i>Piṇḍapāta</i> is not begging. The monks simply walk or stand silently and receive what is offered. </p>

<h4>Almsround FAQ</h4>

<p><i>What should I offer?</i></p>
<p>In Thailand they say, “whatever you want to eat in heaven”! Anything offered is accepted with gratitude.</p>
<p><i>Is there anything I should not offer?</i></p>
<p>Money! We just accept food for the daily meal.</p>
<p><i>Do I have to bring a full meal?</i></p>
<p>Nope. Usually there are several people offering, so any small amount is appeciated.</p>
<p><i>But I can’t cook!</i></p>
<p>We’re in Little India, so there are plenty of options to buy food locally.</p>
<p><i>Are the monks vegetarian?</i></p>
<p>Yes, we are.</p>
<p><i>Any allergies?</i></p>
<p>Not really, but chocolate gives Bhante Sujato a migraine. 😢</p>
<p><i>What happens if there’s too much?</i></p>
<p>We share any extra food with our local community center. Harris Park has many low-income earners, so there are, sadly, always people who don’t have enough to eat.</p>

<h2> House Dana Invitations</h2>
On weekends, the sangha are happy to accept invitations from our lay community who wish to offer a meal at their homes. For more information, please contact <a href="mailto:meditateasy@gmail.com?Subject=Help%20Lokanta">meditateasy@gmail.com</a> Please note that the roster is often booked far in adavance.
