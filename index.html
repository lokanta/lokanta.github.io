<p class="lead">Bhante Sujato and Bhante Akāliko live in Sydney’s Harris Park at the Lokanta Vihara, the “Monastery at the End of the World”. We explore what it means to follow the Buddha’s teachings in an era of climate change, globalised consumerism, and political turmoil.</p>

<h3>Who are we?</h3>

<p>Bhantes Sujato and Akāliko are Australian Buddhist monks, ordained in the Thai lineage of Theravada Buddhism.</p>

<ul><li>Bhante Sujato is a senior teaching monk in Australia and the region. He is currently focussing on leading the team for <a href="https://suttacentral.net/" title="Go to suttacentral">SuttaCentral</a>, a website for early Buddhist texts, translations, and parallels.

<li>Bhante Akāliko is a long term student of Bhante Sujato. He took ordination with Ajahn Brahm in Bodhinyana Monastery, Perth. He is the founder of <a href="https://rainbodhi.org/">Rainbodhi LGBTQIA+ Buddhist Community</a>. He is a Buddhist chaplain at Western Sydney University and on the Board of Directors of the Buddhist Council of NSW.</ul>

<p>At the Monastery at the End of the World we try to be simple, frugal, and content. The little we have is second-hand where possible; either donated or rescued from cast-offs. We rely on the kindness of others, going on alms-round (<i>piṇḍapāta</i>) in our local community for our only meal of the day.</p>

<p>The monks offer an ongoing series of talks and events that will challenge and inspire you to think in new ways about your Dhamma practice. </p>

<h2>Almsround </h2>

<p class="emergency-notice"> The monks will resume their daily almsround from Monday 5th October. </p>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lokanta/lokanta.github.io/master/pindapata.jpg" class="half-right" alt="Photo of Bhante Sujato and Bhante Akaliko on almsround in Harris Park.">

<p> On weekdays, the monks usually go walking for alms-food in the local area (<i>piṇḍapāta</i>). Come along and put some food in the monks’ bowls. Meet on the corner of Wigram and Marion streets, Harris Park, outside the Post Office around 11:00am.</p>

<p>Almsround is a tradition that dates back to the time of the Buddha. The word <i>piṇḍapāta</i> is a combination of two words <i>piṇḍa</i> and <i>pāta</i>. <i>Piṇḍa</i> means “a lump of food” and <i>pāta</i> means “bowl”. So <i>piṇḍapāta</i> means literally “placing of food in a bowl”.</p>

<p><i>Piṇḍapāta</i> is not begging. The monks simply walk or stand silently and receive what is offered. It helps to develop contentedness and humility in the monks, and generosity and service for the people offering. Any extra food is shared with the local Community Center on Albion Street, where it is distributed to local people who cannot feed themselves and their family.</p>

<p>The monastery and the work of the monks is supported by an informal network of Dhamma friends. You can support Lokanta Vihara by offering to help with rent and utilities by contacting Deepika Weerakoon, <a href="mailto:meditateasy@gmail.com?Subject=Help%20Lokanta">meditateasy@gmail.com</a>. The monks do not accept any money directly.</p>
