## About the Monastery at the End of the World

## Lokanta Vihara, the Monastery at the End of the World.

Bhante Sujato and Bhante AkƒÅliko have arrived in Sydney's Harris Park just in time for the End of the World. Lokanta Vihara is part residence, part project; an experiment for living in uncertain times. We want to find out what it means to follow the Buddha's teachings in an era of climate change, globalised consumerism and political turmoil.

At the End of the World we try to be simple, frugal and content. The little we have is second-hand‚Äîwhere possible‚Äîborrowed, shared, or found on the street; just like the ancient tradition of *pa·πÅsukula*, where monastics reused robes from the rubbish heap.

We rely on the kindness of others, going on alms-round (*pi·πá·∏çapƒÅta*) in our local community for our only meal of the day just as monastics did at the time of the Buddha. Living in dependence on our community, we see people caring about each other in a busy world. We practice the Dhamma and share it in return.

Lokanta Vihara offers an ongoing series of talks and events that will challenge and inspire you to think in new ways about your Dhamma practice. 

Imagine our world is ending? How will you live your life?

## Almsround

On weekdays, the monks go walking for (*pindƒÅpata*) alms-food in the local area. Come along and put some food in the monks' bowls. **Meet on the corner of Wigram and Marion streets, Harris Park, outside the Post Office around 11:15am.**

Going on almsround is a tradition that dates back to the time of the Buddha. Here's a few words about the custom of *pi·πá·∏çapƒÅta* from Deepika Weerakoon.

>The word *pi·πá·∏çapƒÅta* is a combination of two words *pi·πá·∏ça* and *pƒÅta*. *Pi·πá·∏ça* means ‚Äúa lump of food‚Äù and *pƒÅta* means ‚Äúbowl‚Äù. So *pi·πá·∏çapƒÅta* means literally ‚Äúplacing of food in a bowl‚Äù.
>
>*Pi·πá·∏çapƒÅta* is not just begging. It‚Äôs a totally different and more meaningful custom. It helps to develop qualities like contentedness and humility in the monks. The people offering the food also benefit by cultivating positive mind states, like generosity and kindness... Keep this beautiful tradition alive! Please take time to offer some food to the monks on *pi·πá·∏çapƒÅta*.
