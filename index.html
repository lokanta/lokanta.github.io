<p class="lead">Bhante Sujato and Bhante Akāliko live at Lokanta Vihara, the “Monastery at the End of the World”. The vihara is located on the lands of the traditional owners, the Burramattagal people of the Darug nation, in Harris Park, Sydney. We pay our respects to Darug elders past, present, and emerging. At Lokanta Vihara, we explore what it means to follow the Buddha’s teachings in an era of climate change, globalised consumerism, and political turmoil.</p>

<h2>Contemplation as Meditation: the Anussatis</h2>
<h3>Easter Long Weekend Sutta Retreat </h3>
<p>
The Buddha taught that reflection, recollection and contemplation have an important role to play in the development of our meditation practice. The anussatis are themes that use particular ideas to help us incline the mind towards wholesome states. These subjects help us to make progress on the spiritual path and develop peace and wisdom. The six main annusatis are: recollecting the Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha, Ethical Conduct, Generosity, and Heavenly Beings. Further contemplations include the body, death, and peace. <br>
</p>
<p>
In this 4-day sutta retreat organised by the Association of Engaged Budhdists, we explore the Buddha’s themes for contemplation, inspiring and uplifting the mind in ways that naturally lead to joyful states and deepen into stillness. 
</p>

<h2>A Heart Full of Love</h2>
<h3>A weekend metta retreat in Stroud</h3>
<p>
Our heart’s capacity for boundless love is sometimes hidden by thoughts of hate, resentment and hurt.

<h2>Taming the Monkey Mind</h2>
<h3>A Weekend Retreat in Cairns</h3>
<p>
When our mind is untrained and uncontrolled, our thoughts jump from one thing to the next, never stopping for a moment of peace. Meditation helps train the mind by identifying unhelpful thoughts and habits that end up causing us suffering. By following the Buddha's teachings, we can learn to let go of negative mind-states and cultivate positive qualities that will lead to happiness and wisdom.
</p>
<p>
Join Bhante Akāliko for this non-residential meditation retreat and explore how to work with the monkey mind.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dates:</strong> Saturday 14th May – Sunday 15th May<br><strong>Times:</strong> 9:00am–4:30pm both days<br><strong>Location:</strong> Chrysalis Relaxation Centre, 129 Mulgrave Rd, Parramatta Park, Cairns <br><strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:cairnsinsightmeditation@gmail.com">cairnsinsightmeditation@gmail.com</a>

<h1>Who are we?</h1>

<p>Bhantes Sujato and Akāliko are Australian Buddhist monks, ordained in the Thai lineage of Theravada Buddhism.</p>

<ul><li>Bhante Sujato is a senior teaching monk in Australia and the region. He is currently focussing on leading the team for <a href="https://suttacentral.net/" title="Go to suttacentral">SuttaCentral</a>, a website for early Buddhist texts, translations, and parallels.

<li>Bhante Akāliko is a long term student of Bhante Sujato. He took ordination with Ajahn Brahm in Bodhinyana Monastery, Perth. He is the founder of <a href="https://rainbodhi.org/">Rainbodhi LGBTQIA+ Buddhist Community</a>. He is a Buddhist chaplain at Western Sydney University and on the Board of Directors of the Buddhist Council of NSW.</ul>

<p>At the Monastery at the End of the World we try to be simple, frugal, and content. The little we have is second-hand where possible; either donated or rescued from cast-offs. We rely on the kindness of others, going on alms-round (<i>piṇḍapāta</i>) in our local community for our only meal of the day.</p>

<p>The monks offer an ongoing series of talks and events that will challenge and inspire you to think in new ways about your Dhamma practice. </p>

<h1 id='pindapata'>Almsround and House Dana Invitations</h1>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lokanta/lokanta.github.io/master/pindapata.jpg" alt="Photo of Bhante Sujato and Bhante Akaliko on almsround in Harris Park.">

<h3>Piṇḍapāta</h3>
<p> On weekdays, the monks walk for alms-food in the local area (<i>piṇḍapāta</i>). Come along and put some food in the monks’ bowls!</p> 
<p><b>Monday to Fridays only. Corner of Wigram and Marion streets, Harris Park, outside the Post Office around 11:00am.</b></p>

<p>Almsround is a tradition that dates back to the time of the Buddha. <i>Piṇḍapāta</i> is not begging. The monks simply walk or stand silently and receive what is offered. </p>

<h4>Almsround FAQ</h4>

<p><i>What should I offer?</i></p>
<p>In Thailand they say, “whatever you want to eat in heaven”! Anything offered is accepted with gratitude.</p>
<p><i>Is there anything I should not offer?</i></p>
<p>Money! We just accept food for the daily meal.</p>
<p><i>Do I have to bring a full meal?</i></p>
<p>Nope. Usually there are several people offering, so any small amount is appeciated.</p>
<p><i>But I can’t cook!</i></p>
<p>We’re in Little India, so there are plenty of options to buy food locally.</p>
<p><i>Are the monks vegetarian?</i></p>
<p>Yes, we are.</p>
<p><i>Any allergies?</i></p>
<p>Not really, but chocolate gives Bhante Sujato a migraine. 😢</p>
<p><i>What happens if there’s too much?</i></p>
<p>We share any extra food with our local community center. Harris Park has many low-income earners, so there are, sadly, always people who don’t have enough to eat.</p>

<h2> House Dana Invitations</h2>
On weekends, the sangha are happy to accept invitations from our lay community who wish to offer a meal at their homes. For more information, please contact <a href="mailto:meditateasy@gmail.com?Subject=Help%20Lokanta">meditateasy@gmail.com</a> Please note that the roster is often booked far in adavance.
