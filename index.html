<h1>Who are we?</h1>

<ul><li>Bhante Sujato is a senior teaching monk in Australia and the region. He is currently focussing on leading the team for <a href="https://suttacentral.net/" title="Go to suttacentral">SuttaCentral</a>, a website for early Buddhist texts, translations, and parallels.


<p>At the Monastery at the End of the World we try to be simple, frugal, and content. The little we have is second-hand where possible; either donated or rescued from cast-offs. We rely on the kindness of others, going on alms-round (<i>pi·πá·∏çapƒÅta</i>) in our local community for our only meal of the day.</p>

<h1 id='pindapata'>Almsround and House Dana Invitations</h1>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lokanta/lokanta.github.io/master/pindapata.jpg" alt="Photo of Bhante Sujato and Bhante Akaliko on almsround in Harris Park.">

<h3>Pi·πá·∏çapƒÅta</h3>
<p> On weekdays, Bhante Sujato walks for alms-food in the local area (<i>pi·πá·∏çapƒÅta</i>). Come along and put some food in the bowl!</p> 
<p><b>Monday to Fridays only. Corner of Wigram and Marion streets, Harris Park, outside the Post Office around 11:00am.</b></p>

<p>Almsround is a tradition that dates back to the time of the Buddha. <i>Pi·πá·∏çapƒÅta</i> is not begging. The monks simply walk or stand silently and receive what is offered. </p>

<h4>Almsround FAQ</h4>

<p><i>What should I offer?</i></p>
<p>In Thailand they say, ‚Äúwhatever you want to eat in heaven‚Äù! Anything offered is accepted with gratitude.</p>
<p><i>Is there anything I should not offer?</i></p>
<p>Money! We just accept food for the daily meal.</p>
<p><i>Do I have to bring a full meal?</i></p>
<p>Nope. Usually there are several people offering, so any small amount is appeciated.</p>
<p><i>But I can‚Äôt cook!</i></p>
<p>We‚Äôre in Little India, so there are plenty of options to buy food locally.</p>
<p><i>Are the monks vegetarian?</i></p>
<p>Yes, we are.</p>
<p><i>Any allergies?</i></p>
<p>Not really, but chocolate gives Bhante Sujato a migraine. üò¢</p>
<p><i>What happens if there‚Äôs too much?</i></p>
<p>We share any extra food with our local community center. Harris Park has many low-income earners, so there are, sadly, always people who don‚Äôt have enough to eat.</p>

<h2> House Dana Invitations</h2>
<p>On weekends, the sangha are happy to accept invitations from our lay community who wish to offer a meal at their homes. For more information, please contact <a href="mailto:meditateasy@gmail.com?Subject=Help%20Lokanta">meditateasy@gmail.com</a> Please note that the roster is often booked far in adavance.</p>
