<p class="lead">Bhante Sujato lives at Lokanta Vihara, the “Monastery at the End of the World”. The vihara is located on the lands of the traditional owners, the Burramattagal people of the Darug nation, in Harris Park, Sydney. We pay our respects to Darug elders past, present, and emerging.</p>

<p>Bhante Sujato is a senior teaching monk in Australia and the region. He is currently focussing on leading the team for <a href="https://suttacentral.net/" title="Go to suttacentral">SuttaCentral</a>, a website for early Buddhist texts, translations, and parallels.</p>

<p>At the Monastery at the End of the World we try to be simple, frugal, and content. The little we have is second-hand where possible; either donated or rescued from cast-offs. We rely on the kindness of others, going on alms-round (<i>piṇḍapāta</i>) in our local community for our only meal of the day.</p>

<h2>End of Vassa Robe Offering</h2>

<p>Each year the community gathers for a special celebration, based on the ancient tradition of the kathina, or robe offering ceremony at the end of the Vassa or Rains Residence. Join us for a joyous occasion.</p>

<h2 id='pindapata'>Almsround and House Dana Invitations</h2>

<table class='pindapata-schedule'>
<caption>Piṇḍapāta—alms-round</caption>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Mon–Fri</td><td>11am, cnr. Wigram + Marion St., Harris Park</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sat/Sun</td><td>No almsround</td></tr>
</tbody>
<tfoot>
 <tr><td>October: Wed 15–Fri 17, no almsround (Bhante is teaching a retreat)</td></tr>
</tfoot>
</table>

<p> On weekdays, Bhante Sujato walks for alms-food in the local area (<i>piṇḍapāta</i>). Come along and put some food in the bowl!</p> 

<p><b>Monday to Fridays only. Corner of Wigram and Marion streets, Harris Park, outside the Post Office around 11:00am.</b></p>

<p>Almsround is a tradition that dates back to the time of the Buddha. <i>Piṇḍapāta</i> is not begging. The monks simply walk or stand silently and receive what is offered. </p>

<h3>Almsround FAQ</h3>

<dl>
<dt><i>What should I offer?</i></dt>
<dd>In Thailand they say, “Offer whatever you want to eat in heaven”! All offerings are accepted with gratitude.</dd>
<dt><i>Is there anything I should not offer?</i></dt>
<dd>Thanks for asking. There is one thing: money! 💰 We just accept food for the daily meal.</dd>
<dt><i>Do I have to bring a full meal?</i></dt>
<dd>Nope. Usually there are several people offering, so any small amount is appreciated.</dd>
<dt><i>But I can’t cook!</i></dt>
<dd>We’re in Little India, so there are plenty of restaraunts and shops where you can buy food locally.</dd>
<dt><i>Are the monks vegetarian?</i></dt>
<dd>Yes, we are. 🥕 🍍 🥦 🍚</dd>
<dt><i>Any allergies?</i></dt>
<dd>Not really, but chocolate gives Bhante Sujato a migraine. 😢</dd>
<dt><i>What happens if there’s too much?</i></dt>
<dd>We share extra food with our local community center. Harris Park has many low-income earners, so there are, sadly, always people who don’t have enough to eat.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>House Dana</h3>
<p>On weekends, the sangha are happy to accept invitations from our lay community who wish to offer a meal at their homes. For more information, contact <a href="mailto:meditateasy@gmail.com?Subject=Help%20Lokanta">meditateasy@gmail.com</a>. Please note that the roster may be booked in adavance.</p>
