<p class="lead">Bhante Sujato lives at Lokanta Vihara, the “Monastery at the End of the World”. The vihara is located on the lands of the Burramattagal people of the Darug nation, in Parramatta, Sydney. We pay our respects to Darug elders past, present, and emerging.</p>

<p>Bhante Sujato is a senior teaching monk in Australia and the region. He is currently focussing on leading the team for <a href="https://suttacentral.net/" title="Go to suttacentral">SuttaCentral</a>, a website for early Buddhist texts, translations, and parallels.</p>

<h2>Teachings & meditation</h2>

<h2 id='pindapata'>Almsround and House Dana Invitations</h2>

<table class='pindapata-schedule'>
<caption>Piṇḍapāta—alms-round</caption>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Mon–Fri</td><td>11am, cnr. Wigram + Marion St., Harris Park</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sat/Sun</td><td>No almsround</td></tr>
</tbody>
<tfoot>
 <tr><td>December: Tues 23–Thurs 25</td><td>No almsround</td></tr>

</table>

<p> On weekdays, Bhante Sujato walks for alms-food in the local area (<i>piṇḍapāta</i>). Come along and put some food in the bowl!</p> 

<p><b>Monday to Fridays only. Corner of Wigram and Marion streets, Harris Park, outside the Post Office around 11:00am.</b></p>

<p>Almsround is a tradition that dates back to the time of the Buddha. <i>Piṇḍapāta</i> is not begging. The monks simply walk or stand silently and receive what is offered. </p>

<h3>Almsround FAQ</h3>

<dl>
<dt><i>What should I offer?</i></dt>
<dd>In Thailand they say, “Offer whatever you want to eat in heaven”! All offerings are accepted with gratitude.</dd>
<dt><i>Is there anything I should not offer?</i></dt>
<dd>Thanks for asking. There is one thing: money! 💰 We just accept food for the daily meal.</dd>
<dt><i>Do I have to bring a full meal?</i></dt>
<dd>Nope. Usually there are several people offering, so any small amount is appreciated.</dd>
<dt><i>But I can’t cook!</i></dt>
<dd>We’re in Little India, so there are plenty of restaraunts and shops where you can buy food locally.</dd>
<dt><i>Should I offer vegetarian?</i></dt>
<dd>Yes, thanks for asking. 🥕 🍍 🥦 🍚</dd>
<dt><i>Any allergies?</i></dt>
<dd>Not really, but chocolate gives Bhante Sujato a migraine. 😢</dd>
<dt><i>What happens if there’s too much?</i></dt>
<dd>We share extra food with our local community center. Harris Park has many low-income earners, so there are, sadly, always people who don’t have enough to eat.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>House Dana</h3>
