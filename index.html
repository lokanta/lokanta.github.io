<p class="lead">Bhante Sujato and Bhante AkƒÅliko live at Lokanta Vihara, the ‚ÄúMonastery at the End of the World‚Äù. The vihara is located on the lands of the traditional owners, the Burramattagal people of the Darug nation, in Harris Park, Sydney. We pay our respects to Darug elders past, present, and emerging. At Lokanta Vihara, we explore what it means to follow the Buddha‚Äôs teachings in an era of climate change, globalised consumerism, and political turmoil.</p>

<h1>Who are we?</h1>

<ul><li>Bhante Sujato is a senior teaching monk in Australia and the region. He is currently focussing on leading the team for <a href="https://suttacentral.net/" title="Go to suttacentral">SuttaCentral</a>, a website for early Buddhist texts, translations, and parallels.


<p>At the Monastery at the End of the World we try to be simple, frugal, and content. The little we have is second-hand where possible; either donated or rescued from cast-offs. We rely on the kindness of others, going on alms-round (<i>pi·πá·∏çapƒÅta</i>) in our local community for our only meal of the day.</p>

<p>The monks offer an ongoing series of talks and events that will challenge and inspire you to think in new ways about your Dhamma practice. </p>

<h1 id='pindapata'>Almsround and House Dana Invitations</h1>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lokanta/lokanta.github.io/master/pindapata.jpg" alt="Photo of Bhante Sujato and Bhante Akaliko on almsround in Harris Park.">

<h3>Pi·πá·∏çapƒÅta</h3>
<p> On weekdays, the monks walk for alms-food in the local area (<i>pi·πá·∏çapƒÅta</i>). Come along and put some food in the monks‚Äô bowls!</p> 
<p><b>Monday to Fridays only. Corner of Wigram and Marion streets, Harris Park, outside the Post Office around 11:00am.</b></p>

<p>Almsround is a tradition that dates back to the time of the Buddha. <i>Pi·πá·∏çapƒÅta</i> is not begging. The monks simply walk or stand silently and receive what is offered. </p>

<h4>Almsround FAQ</h4>

<p><i>What should I offer?</i></p>
<p>In Thailand they say, ‚Äúwhatever you want to eat in heaven‚Äù! Anything offered is accepted with gratitude.</p>
<p><i>Is there anything I should not offer?</i></p>
<p>Money! We just accept food for the daily meal.</p>
<p><i>Do I have to bring a full meal?</i></p>
<p>Nope. Usually there are several people offering, so any small amount is appeciated.</p>
<p><i>But I can‚Äôt cook!</i></p>
<p>We‚Äôre in Little India, so there are plenty of options to buy food locally.</p>
<p><i>Are the monks vegetarian?</i></p>
<p>Yes, we are.</p>
<p><i>Any allergies?</i></p>
<p>Not really, but chocolate gives Bhante Sujato a migraine. üò¢</p>
<p><i>What happens if there‚Äôs too much?</i></p>
<p>We share any extra food with our local community center. Harris Park has many low-income earners, so there are, sadly, always people who don‚Äôt have enough to eat.</p>

<h2> House Dana Invitations</h2>
On weekends, the sangha are happy to accept invitations from our lay community who wish to offer a meal at their homes. For more information, please contact <a href="mailto:meditateasy@gmail.com?Subject=Help%20Lokanta">meditateasy@gmail.com</a> Please note that the roster is often booked far in adavance.
