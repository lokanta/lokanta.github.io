<p class="lead">Bhante Sujato and Bhante Akāliko live at Lokanta Vihara, the “Monastery at the End of the World”. The vihara is loacted on the lands of the traditional owners, the Burramattagal people of the Darug nation, in Harris Park, Sydney. We pay our respects to Darug elders past, present, and emerging.

<br>
<h3>Jayatilleke's Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge: a 5 week course with Bhante Sujato</h3>
 <p><i>Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge</i> (EBTOK) is a seminal book of Buddhist philosophy by the eminent scholar K.N. Jayatilleke. A student of Ludwig Wittgenstein, Jayatilleke applied a rigorous analytical style to examine the early Buddhist approach to one of the central problems of philosophy: how we know what we know. Join Bhante Sujato for this in-depth 5 week course every Saturday afternoon in July at the Buddhist Library. </p>
  
 <p><b> Dates: 5 Saturdays in July: 3rd, 10th, 17th, 24th, 31st from 3–5pm.</p></b>
<p>Participants should aim to attend all sessions and read the course content, a PDF version of the book can be downloaded <a href="http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Early%20Buddhist%20Theory%20of%20Knowledge_Jayatilleke.pdf">here</a>.</p>

 <h3>Sutta Reading for Poets and Engineers: a 4 week online course with Bhante Sujato for the Barre Centre</h3>
 <p>Let’s read a few small and quirky Suttas together. Best not to start reading Suttas by grappling with massive ideological tomes. How about a witty exchange of verses—a rap battle if you will—or an unexpected encounter with a mysterious stranger? By training on small things, we learn the skills for bigger ones. In this course we will read together a lesser-known Sutta each session, exploring the four approaches. Exercising our reading skills in this way trains us to recognize the value of different approaches to the Suttas, without being trapped in any one of them.</p>
  
<p><b>Dates:</p></b>   
<p><b>Australia:</b> AEST (UTC+10) Monday mornings 08:30–10:30, 19th and 26th July, 2nd and 9th August</p> 
 <p><b>USA:</b> EDT (UTC-4) Sunday evenings 18:30–20:30 18th and 25th July, 1st and 8th August</p>   

<p>Registration is essential. Please check the time of the group meetings in your timezone <a href="https://www.worldtimebuddy.com">here</a>, and please note that sessions will not be recorded.</p>

 <h3> How to Heal your Hate with Bhante Akaliko</h3> 
<i>Organised by Australian Association of Buddhist Counsellors and Psychotherapists (AABCAP)</i>
<p>Sometimes life can leave scars in our hearts that make us hurt and unhappy. Sometimes our personal and collective trauma leads to hatred towards others, or for the world. However if we are not careful, strong emotions like resentment and hatred will overwhelm our mind, destroying our peace and happiness. Join Bhante Akaliko for a guided meditation and discover the Buddha’s advice on how we can heal our hate, so that we can fill our hearts with loving kindness and compassion instead.</p>  

<p><b>Date:</b> Tuesday 1st June, 19:00–20:30 AEST (UTC+10) 
<p><b>Location</b>: Two options: Attend via zoom, or in-person at Buddhist Library, 90-92 Church St, Camperdown NSW 2050</p>

 <h3>Spiritual Bypassing & Buddhism: Two part online workshop with Bhante Akāliko</h3>
 <p><i>Hosted by Tilorien iSangha and Auralis Buddhist Community</i><br>
<p>Join Bhante Akāliko for this two-part interactive online workshop exploring common pitfalls and mistakes on the spiritual path and learn how we can avoid them. The term Spiritual Bypassing was coined by Buddhist psychologist John Welwood in the 1980's and further developed by Rob Masters. It describes what happens when we misunderstand spiritual teachings in a way that becomes harmful and prevents real spiritual growth.</p>

<p>These two sessions explore a variety of Spiritual Bypassing tendencies, including: anger-phobia; hyper-positivity; emotional suppression; exaggerated detachment; idealising the transcendent; false self-view; and deluded spiritual attainments.</p>
 
<p><b>Dates:</b> Saturday 10th and Sunday 11th July, 
<p>Sydney: 17:00–19:00 AEST (UTC+10)<br>
<p>Belgium: 09:00-11:00 CEST (UTC+2)</p>

<h2>Who are we?</h2>

<p>Bhantes Sujato and Akāliko are Australian Buddhist monks, ordained in the Thai lineage of Theravada Buddhism.</p>

<ul><li>Bhante Sujato is a senior teaching monk in Australia and the region. He is currently focussing on leading the team for <a href="https://suttacentral.net/" title="Go to suttacentral">SuttaCentral</a>, a website for early Buddhist texts, translations, and parallels.

<li>Bhante Akāliko is a long term student of Bhante Sujato. He took ordination with Ajahn Brahm in Bodhinyana Monastery, Perth. He is the founder of <a href="https://rainbodhi.org/">Rainbodhi LGBTQIA+ Buddhist Community</a>. He is a Buddhist chaplain at Western Sydney University and on the Board of Directors of the Buddhist Council of NSW.</ul>

<p>At the Monastery at the End of the World we try to be simple, frugal, and content. The little we have is second-hand where possible; either donated or rescued from cast-offs. We rely on the kindness of others, going on alms-round (<i>piṇḍapāta</i>) in our local community for our only meal of the day.</p>

<p>The monks offer an ongoing series of talks and events that will challenge and inspire you to think in new ways about your Dhamma practice. </p>

<h2>Almsround and House Dana Invitations</h2>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lokanta/lokanta.github.io/master/pindapata.jpg" alt="Photo of Bhante Sujato and Bhante Akaliko on almsround in Harris Park.">

<h3>Piṇḍapāta</h3>
<p> On weekdays, the monks  go walking for alms-food in the local area (<i>piṇḍapāta</i>). Come along and put some food in the monks’ bowls.</p> 
<p><b>Monday to Fridays only. Meet on the corner of Wigram and Marion streets, Harris Park, outside the Post Office around 11:00am.</b></p>

<p>Almsround is a tradition that dates back to the time of the Buddha.<i>Piṇḍapāta</i> is not begging. The monks simply walk or stand silently and receive what is offered. It helps to develop contentedness and humility in the monks, and generosity and service for the people offering. Any extra food is shared with the local Community Center on Albion Street, where it is distributed to local people who cannot feed themselves and their family.</p>

<h3> House Dana Invitations</h3>
On weekends, the sangha are happy to accept invitations from our lay community who wish to offer a meal at their homes. For more information, please contact <a href="mailto:meditateasy@gmail.com?Subject=Help%20Lokanta">meditateasy@gmail.com</a> Please note that the roster is often booked far in adavance.
