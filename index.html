<h1>About the Monastery at the End of the World</h1>

<p>Bhante Sujato and Bhante Akāliko have arrived in Sydney's Harris Park just in time for the End of the World. Lokanta Vihara is a monastic residence for uncertain times. We want to find out what it means to follow the Buddha's teachings in an era of climate change, globalised consumerism and political turmoil.</p>

<p>At the End of the World we try to be simple, frugal, and content. The little we have is second-hand—where possible—borrowed, shared, or found on the street; just like the ancient tradition of <i>paṁsukula</i>, where monastics reused robes from the rubbish heap.</p>

<p>We rely on the kindness of others, going on alms-round (<i>piṇḍapāta</i>) in our local community for our only meal of the day just as monastics did at the time of the Buddha. Living in dependence on our community, we see people caring about each other in a busy world. We practice the Dhamma and share it in return.</p>

<p>Lokanta Vihara offers an ongoing series of talks and events that will challenge and inspire you to think in new ways about your Dhamma practice. </p>

<p>Imagine our world is ending? How will you live your life?</p>

<h2>Almsround </h2>

<p>On weekdays, the monks usually go walking for alms-food in the local area (<i>pindāpata</i>) . Come along and put some food in the monks’ bowls. Meet on the corner of Wigram and Marion streets, Harris Park, outside the Post Office around 11:00am.</p>

<p>Almsround is a tradition that dates back to the time of the Buddha. The word <i>piṇḍapāta</i> is a combination of two words <i>piṇḍa</i> and <i>pāta</i>. <i>Piṇḍa</i> means “a lump of food” and <i>pāta</i> means “bowl”. So <i>piṇḍapāta</i> means literally “placing of food in a bowl”.</p>

<p><i>Piṇḍapāta</i> is not begging. The monks simply walk or stand silently and receive what is offered. It helps to develop contentedness and humility in the monks, and generosity and service for the people offering. Any extra food is shared with the local Community Center on Albion Street, where it is distributed to local people who cannot feed themselves and their family.</p>
