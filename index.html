<p class="lead">Bhante Sujato and Bhante Akāliko have come to Sydney’s Harris Park to set up Lokanta Vihara, the “Monastery at the End of the World”. We explore what it means to follow the Buddha’s teachings in an era of climate change, globalised consumerism, and political turmoil.</p>

<p>At the Monastery at the End of the World we try to be simple, frugal, and content. The little we have is second-hand where possible; either donated or rescued from cast-offs. We rely on the kindness of others, going on alms-round (<i>piṇḍapāta</i>) in our local community for our only meal of the day.</p>

<p>The monks offer an ongoing series of talks and events that will challenge and inspire you to think in new ways about your Dhamma practice. </p>

<h3>Buddhist Death Contemplation with Bhante Akaliko</h3>

Going to a cemetery to contemplate death was recommended by the Buddha to inspire a sense of urgency and help develop wisdom.

Join Bhante Akāliko at Sydney's oldest functioning necropolis, Rookwood Cemetery, for a Dhamma discussion and guided meditation on the theme of death.</p>

<p>Sunday 22nd March at 4:00—6:00pm.

<h2>Almsround </h2>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lokanta/lokanta.github.io/master/pindapata.jpg" class="half-right" alt="Photo of Bhante Sujato and Bhante Akaliko on almsround in Harris Park.">

<p>On weekdays, the monks usually go walking for alms-food in the local area (<i>piṇḍapāta</i>) . Come along and put some food in the monks’ bowls. Meet on the corner of Wigram and Marion streets, Harris Park, outside the Post Office around 11:00am.</p>

<p>Almsround is a tradition that dates back to the time of the Buddha. The word <i>piṇḍapāta</i> is a combination of two words <i>piṇḍa</i> and <i>pāta</i>. <i>Piṇḍa</i> means “a lump of food” and <i>pāta</i> means “bowl”. So <i>piṇḍapāta</i> means literally “placing of food in a bowl”.</p>

<p><i>Piṇḍapāta</i> is not begging. The monks simply walk or stand silently and receive what is offered. It helps to develop contentedness and humility in the monks, and generosity and service for the people offering. Any extra food is shared with the local Community Center on Albion Street, where it is distributed to local people who cannot feed themselves and their family.</p>

<p>You can also support Lokanta Vihara by offering to help with rent and utilities by contacting Deepika Weerakoon, <a href="mailto:meditateasy@gmail.com?Subject=Help%20Lokanta">meditateasy@gmail.com</a>. The monks do not accept any money directly.</p>
