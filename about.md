## Lokanta Vihara, the Monastery at the End of the World.

Bhante Sujato and Bhante Akāliko have arrived in Sydney's Harris Park just in time for the End of the World. Lokanta Vihara is part residence, part project; an experiment for living in uncertain times. We want to find out what it means to follow the Buddha's teachings in an era of climate change, globalised consumerism and political turmoil.

At the End of the World we try to be simple, frugal and content. The little we have is second-hand—where possible—borrowed, shared, or found on the street; just like the ancient tradition of *paṁsukula*, where monastics reused robes from the rubbish heap.

We rely on the kindness of others, going on alms-round (*piṇḍapāta*) in our local community for our only meal of the day just as monastics did at the time of the Buddha. Living in dependence on our community, we see people caring about each other in a busy world. We practice the Dhamma and share it in return.

Lokanta Vihara offers an ongoing series of talks and events that will challenge and inspire you to think in new ways about your Dhamma practice. 

Imagine our world is ending? How will you live your life?

We have a lot of ideas for the coming weeks and months. We’ll be using this blog as a primary web hub, so check back in to see what we’re up to.
