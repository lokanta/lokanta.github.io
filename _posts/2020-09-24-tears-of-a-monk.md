## Tears of a Monk
The Buddha said that the flow of tears we have shed during our countless rebirths in samsara,is greater than all the water in the oceans, and therefore: 'This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions.' Sometimes the suffering of the world affects us deeply. Bodhisattas who weep tears of compassion for the world are a common motif in the Mahayana tradition. During intensive meditation the mind becomes very sensitive and meditators report experiencing an emotional release that brings a flood of tears. Sometimes, thinking about the kindness and generosity we have received from others can overwhelm us with tears of gratitude. And then there are tears of happiness and joy.

Sitting by the stream,<br>

The whole world is suffering.<br>
My heart cannot bear it.<br>

Some monk!<br>

Do not sorrow.<br> 
Do not grieve.<br>
Seeing only the suffering<br>
you miss the hope.<br>
