title: Forest Poems 1: Faux-kus 
author: Bhante Akāliko
blurb: Part One of a collection of poems written during 2016–2018 whilst residing at Bodhinyana Monastery in Serpentine, Western Australia. Inspired by the poems of the senior nuns and monks from the *Therīgāthā* and *Theragāthā*, as well as the later Chan and Zen literary traditions, these poems are a homage to the ideal of the rustic solitude of a forest monastic. They explore themes of impermanence, death, melancholy, as well as the joys and struggles of meditation.

## Faux-kus

I call these poems *Faux-kus* because they are faux haikus; written in a deliberate stylistic homage to Zen poetry but not adhering to haiku’s rigid metrical structure. Many of the haiku genre’s conventions are retained, such as brevity, seasonal references and the use of impressionistic suggestion to convey mood.

**Just Ordained**

Waking in my little hut 
to see my new robes
hanging up

Hugging them 
out of happiness.

I'm a monk! I'm a monk!

**Shioak **

If anyone ever asks
if plants have feelings 
just tell them to look 
at the tender way 
the shioak tree cradles her dead children
in loving bent arms.


\* * *


**Spring Green** 

Today my treat 
is sinking my feet 
into cool thick clouds of clover.


\* * *


The coldness of the 
Late spring rain 
has brought back 
winter’s melancholy.

**Permission to a thief**

Go on little robin! 
Take as much thread 
as you need
from my shoes. 

Make your nest 
warm and cosy.


\* * *


Ah nature! 
I inhale you deeply.
Eyes to the sky

Bliss.


\* * *


Go ahead little ants, 
make your home in my umbrella. 

The rain is coming.


\* * *


Since I moved huts 
my old forest paths 
have started to disappear. 

My footsteps 
gone. 

Forgotten. 


\* * *


The wisdom 
of the flower
blossoming

in the darkness.


\* * *


**Content** 

Sitting in the forest
Rain clouds coming. 
I don't care if I get wet.


\* * *


**Matinée**

When the sun is shining,
the metal roof of my hut 
becomes a stage 
for little lizard’s
to dance. 
Their footsteps 
drumming a beat, 

then 
a theatrical pause 
to strike a pose
and warm themselves up. 


\* * *


**Night**

The shadows are malevolent. 
The mosquito's buzz
is full of anger.

Tonight I am 
an unwelcome guest
but still I'll stay 
and sit a while longer. 
Unafraid of the darkness. 

Radiating light.


\* * *


**Listening**

Winter’s first rain 
drips into the drain pipe.

Music.


\* * *


**Bones**

On the wet earth, 
everywhere bones. 
Bones of animal bones
Bones of trees 
all broken now and useless. 

And so it is. And so it is.


\* * *


Resting now 
Face to the sky 
Eyes closed
Feeling the sunlight through branches. 
Warm. 
Content. 
Satisfied.


\* * *


**Heavenly Realms**

If you want to join 
the feeders of heavenly nectar

first you’ll need 
to seek the nectar in the earthy flower

then set your intention
and expectation 
on the celestial fruit.


\* * *


**Illusion**

Little children 
offering 
imaginary tea from imaginary cups—
Make believe.
Illusion. 

This is how to see the world; 
Playing games for children.

But knowing. 
Always knowing.


\* * *


 **Winter Winds**

Screw you wind. 
Throw yourself at my hut. 
Snap branches
Crack trees. 
But 
you will not break me! 
I shall sit here 

still 
silent 
and resolute.
