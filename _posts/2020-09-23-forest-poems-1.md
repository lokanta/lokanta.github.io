title: Forest Poems 1—Faux-kus
author: Bhante Akāliko
blurb:  Part One of a collection of poems written during 2016–2018 whilst residing at Bodhinyana Monastery in Serpentine, Western Australia. Inspired by the poems of the senior nuns and monks from the <i>Therīgāthā</i> and <i>Theragāthā</i>, as well as the later Chan and Zen literary traditions, these poems are a homage to the ideal of the rustic solitude of a forest monastic. They explore themes of impermanence, death, melancholy, as well as the joys and struggles of meditation.

## Faux-kus

I call these poems *Faux-kus* because they are faux haikus; written in a deliberate stylistic homage to Zen poetry but not adhering to haiku’s rigid metrical structure. Many of the haiku genre’s conventions are retained, such as brevity, seasonal references and the use of impressionistic suggestion to convey mood.

<h3>Just Ordained</h3>

<p>Waking in my little hut<br> 
to see my new robes<br>
hanging up</p>

<p>Hugging them<br> 
out of happiness.</p>

<p>I'm a monk! I'm a monk!</p>

<h3>Shioak</h3>

<p>If anyone ever asks<br>
if plants have feelings<br>
just tell them to look<br>
at the tender way<br> 
the shioak tree cradles her dead children<br>
in loving bent arms.</p>

<h3>Spring Green </h3>

<p>Today my treat<br> 
is sinking my feet<br> 
into cool thick clouds of clover.</p>

<hr>

<p>The coldness of the<br> 
Late spring rain<br> 
has brought back<br>
winter’s melancholy.</p>

<h3>Permission to a thief</h3>

<p>Go on little robin!<br> 
Take as much thread<br> 
as you need<br> 
Make your nest<br> 
warm and cosy.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ah nature!<br> 
I inhale you deeply.<br>
Eyes to the sky</p>

<p>Bliss.</p>

<hr>

<p>Go ahead little ants,<br> 
make your home in my umbrella. </p>

<p>The rain is coming.</p>

<hr>

<p>Since I moved huts<br> 
my old forest paths<br> 
have started to disappear. </p>

<p>My footsteps<br> 
gone. </p>

<p>Forgotten.</p>

<hr>

<p>The wisdom<br> 
of the flower<br>
blossoming</p>

<p>in the darkness.</p>

<hr>

<p>Sitting in the forest<br>
Rain clouds coming.<br> 
I don't care if I get wet.</p>

<h3>Matinée</h3>

<p>When the sun is shining,<br>
the metal roof of my hut <br>
becomes a stage<br> 
for little lizard’s<br>
to dance.<br> 
Their footsteps<br> 
drumming a beat, </p>

<p>then<br> 
a theatrical pause<br> 
to strike a pose<br>
and warm themselves up.</p>

<h3>Night</h3>

<p>The shadows are malevolent.<br> 
The mosquito's buzz<br>
is full of anger.</p>

<p>Tonight I am<br> 
an unwelcome guest<br>
but still I'll stay<br> 
and sit a while longer.<br>
Unafraid of the darkness. </p>

<p>Radiating light.</p>

<hr>

<p>Winter’s first rain<br> 
drips into the drain pipe.</p>

<p>Music.</p>

<h3>Bones</h3>

<p>On the wet earth,<br> 
everywhere bones.<br> 
Bones of animal bones<br>
Bones of trees<br>
all broken now and useless. </p>

<p>And so it is. And so it is.</p>

<hr>

<p>Resting now<br> 
Face to the sky<br> 
Eyes closed<br>
Feeling the sunlight through branches.<br>
Warm.<br> 
Content.<br> 
Satisfied.</p>

<h3>Heavenly Realms</h3>

<p>If you want to join<br> 
the feeders of heavenly nectar</p>

<p>first you’ll need<br>
to seek the nectar in the earthy flower</p>

<p>then set your intention<br>
and expectation<br> 
on the celestial fruit.</p>

<h3>Illusion</h3>

<p>Little children<br> 
offering<br> 
imaginary tea from imaginary cups—<br>
Make believe.<br>
Illusion.</p>

<p>This is how to see the world;<br>
Playing games for children.</p>

<p>But knowing.<br> 
Always knowing.</p>

<h3>Winter Winds</h3>

<p>Screw you wind.<br> 
Throw yourself at my hut.<br> 
Snap branches<br>
Crack trees.<br>
But<br> 
you will not break me!<br> 
I shall sit here </p>

<p>still<br> 
silent<br> 
and resolute. </p>
