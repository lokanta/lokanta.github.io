The endless miles are not really endless; it's just the lens makes them look that way. The sky vaults, the cacti prickle, the snakes rattle. And there he walks.

His boots of leather and fortitude are worn down on the heel, a little to one side. His canvas jeans have never been washed. He has known love, a love so intense and passionate that it could never last, never be spoken of. Yet he is alone, as he has ever been. His pace is slow, his steps quiet. Or he sits upon a horse, a magnificent beast all black, or palomino, or all white; something special, anyway. His eyes are narrow, his face unshaven. They call him a cowboy, but make no mistake: this is no boy. He is a man.

It is not his slouch hat that marks him out, or his impassive face, or his relaxed, easy gait. No, his truest self hangs low on his hip. Like a guitar, it's more practical worn higher; but it looks cool down low. Sexy. Dangerous. And you just know, he is going to pull it, faster than anyone else, and fire it, more precise than anyone else. You know he has used it in the past. You can see it in his eyes: he bears the weight of another man's life. And you know that when the time comes he will not hesitate to use it again. 

He walks with death at his side.

Women cannot resist him; not that he gives them a choice. All eyes are on him when he enters the saloon. He drinks harder than the rest, wins at dice, then throws the prettiest girl over his shoulder and takes her upstairs. She is laughing. He is not.

No-one would mistake him for a good man. His anger is of legend, and his vengeance may not be stayed. Yet he has a reserve, for he he wants nothing. That is what sets him apart from the rustlers, the ranchers, the bankers, and the pimps; and most of all, from the men who believe laws can be written down in books. If he has a morality, it is an old one, predating the modern fripperies of compassion and love. He follows the code that existed before commandments were written in stone. It has always been there. You can just about make out his image, or one like enough, in the stones of old Assyria. He was already old then. 

He carries within him a sort of wisdom. He is closest to his horse, and it is, perhaps, on a horse that this wisdom was born. His wisdom is not that of the soft, deskbound men with their cravats and their cumberbunds, the prisoners of words and slaves of intellect. Nor is it the knowledge of the sky and the air, the grasses and the beasts, though he knows these things well enough. The towns, the laws, the histories, the birds, the rivers, these things are all incidentals. They come and go, while he keeps walking. 

He serves not his family or clan, his culture or traditions, his country or its laws. He learns the name of a valley or a humble outpost, but holds all names at a distance, like a foreign thing. 

He is no-one. He serves only himself. His is the only morality that matters, in the end. The inexorable logic of survival. You live or you die. 

He lives, discarding perhaps one form or another, yet always appearing again, always walking, always westward. Slow, unstoppable, the setting sun in his face. He walks from the cold and grey into the harsh, dry wilderness, from the played out decadence of the old world to build a new city, carved from the desert by sheer force of will.  

It is hard to argue with survival. Many did not make it, it is true. The innocent townsfolk were good-hearted people from back East who just wanted to start a new life. A young married couple from a poor village. A widow from some war. A fresh-eyed graduate from a smart school. A naive pastor who wanted only to minister to the needy. And they were always under one threat or another. The road was long and bloody. Bad men in black hats or black skin tried to take what little they had with force. Yellow-bellied cowards or yellow-skinned Chinese were scheming and plotting. And the hooting and terrifying natives descended in clouds, with the horses and guns they learned from the white men. 

The stranger did not like to kill. He did not like anything much. But he did it anyway, for that was who he was. They called him "justice" or "law" or "vengeance", but he cared little for those things. For some to live, others must die. That was how it always had been. 

So as the dust cleared and the sound settled, as bodies lay bleeding in the dirt, the townsfolk emerged, alive. They had made it one more day. As they gathered their things and prepared to head West, they wanted to thank him. But they only saw his back, his feet already kicking up dust. He did not want thanks. He did not want anything at all. 

His only allegiance was necessity.

The Western is California's origin legend. It is a story required by circumstance, one of the rare occasions when humanity invented a whole new way of telling stories; reality frozen in liquid light. By the time Hollywood was getting its legs, the Western was glowing in that perfect twilight sun; not quite real but not yet entirely false. 

The mongers of dreams quickly grew rich. They shone their visions on the silver screen, and the whole world showed up to watch. Their dreams became our dreams, and when the leaves were brown and the skies were grey, we all dreamed of California. The sun is brighter there, the faces more beautiful, and the future shone in the light of the silver screen.

A dream, though, is just a dream. People have always told stories, and it is a funny thing that if you look closely, those stories, no matter how fabulous, always contain a teeny bit of truth. It seems we can't really tell stories of nothing. What was new was how California learned that if you dream brightly enough, spark enough vivid visions in enough lonely minds, you can turn dreams into reality.

Now we are drawn into our machines with their bewitching screens. Silicon valley turns dreams into reality. Computers make the future mundane. 

When we grew tired of Westerns, Hollywood began telling a new kind of story. In this story, we met laconic men with no past or future, who carried lethal weapons at their hips; but now they shot lasers, not bullets. The Space Western, they called it. We had finished our walk to the west, and the endless miles of desert had met their match: we made it to the sea. Lazy men were content, they thought it good enough, so they smoked weed, played guitar, and rode the waves. 

But the stranger would not long be sated. Necessity stirred in the hearts of the few. They lifted their faces to gaze into space and saw there a new frontier. Around them, the once-promised land had turned soft and corrupt, its dreams endlessly recycled, its possibilities filtered and sanded down, adapted to the realities of market pressures and the practicalities of mortgages on houses with taps and granite kitchen benches. 

The cycle was renewed; the land once promised was trapped in the decadence of the old world. Instead of the all-consuming pettifoggery of Christian moralizing and stifling civilities, we have the all-consuming political correctness of pronouns and diversity. Morality changes, but to the few it is always a cage. So they snarl and claw, and the guardians of the cage point and say, "See? That is why we need a cage." 

Then the few get out. And the stranger walks among them once more. He knows them well, and is not fooled by their delusions and their lies. He knows full well that they are full of it, small and desperate men with illusions of magnificence. Tacky, transparent, impotent in sex, they are consumed with rage at the unrighteousness of a world where so many mediocrities, quailing at the challenge, simply do not comprehend their singular genius. Those others, the grey ones with their suits and their forms, their ossified thoughts and predictable desires.

There are two stories. The story of California is the hero's journey, where a lonely man sets out across the wilderness to bring salvation by defeating the dragon. Then there is the horror story, where a woman must stay inside, where the fear is coming from inside the home, and she must survive the hairy monster in the bedroom. 

The left and the right are living in two different stories. The left is trapped in a house of horrors, where the only virtue is staying alive and restoring order. The right want to be heroes, and they want to conquer a new land. The left fear that when they do so they will merely recreate the horrors of the old. They are right, but the right does not care. It's the adventure they crave. The call of the Stranger.
