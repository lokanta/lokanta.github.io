machines make everything worse    
so we hide it away    
we hide it in the future    
we hide it in other places    
we bury it underground    
so we don’t see it    
and we don’t know it    
and we don’t care about it    
but it’s there    
and somehow    
it makes everything worse    
in smashing    
and in killing    
in degradation    
and pollution    
it all gets worse    
but it seems better    
if we don’t look too hard    
or think about    
what’s behind the door    
because there    
everything is worse    
it’s worse because we made it worse    
because of our machines    
our machines made it worse    
but don’t worry too much    
there is an answer    
and the answer is easy    
and the answer is waiting    
and the answer is ready to serve    
and the answer is always the same    
more machines    
better machines    
bigger machines    
so we build     
more machines    
better machines    
bigger machines    
and they just make everything worse    
and we have no other answer    
and we have forgotten what else we can do    
and we forgot that machines exist to serve us    
not we to serve machines    
so even when we know    
that machines make everything worse    
we go right ahead and build more machines    
because we believe them    
the makers of machines    
the masters and commanders    
they know    
they must    
they see further than us    
because they have better machines    
and if the machines do not fix the problem    
and if the machines do not solve the issue    
and if the machines do not repair the damage    
if they just make everything worse    
at least we can     
bow    
for it feels good to bow    
it feels good to give in    
it feels good to let    
the machines fulfill their destiny    
to let the machines be greater    
and us lesser    
to worship them     
our new gods    
because what did the old gods do for us anyway?    
let our souls be acid    
and our thoughts be fire    
and our veins be metal    
let us be worse    
because machines make everything worse    
or    
did it once happen that on the sandy shore    
with decayed plastic underfoot    
and the strewn nets of trawlers    
and the ickily warm grey waters    
oily and limp    
that it stuck in your bare foot     
ouch    
and you bent down and picked it up    
white with its fibonacci swirls    
a sea shell    
and you remembered    
so long ago a child    
and you put it to your ear    
~~whoosh~~whoosh~~
