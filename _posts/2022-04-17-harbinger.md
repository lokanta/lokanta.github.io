<p class="preamble">“Harbingers” was an ongoing series of articles, stories, and reflections by Bhante Sujato on living in the age of global warming. Then it became a novel.</p>

My first novel, *The Harbingers*, is released. Order a print copy, or read as ebook or online.

This book came about after writing several essays in the harbingers series that are posted here. I realized they could fit into the same world, and starting weaving them together. So some chapters might be familiar!
