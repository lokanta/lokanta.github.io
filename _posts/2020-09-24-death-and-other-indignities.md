## Death and Other Indignities
These poems explore the practice of <i>asubha</i>, or reflecting on the repulsive, a method the Buddha recommended to help overcome sense desire and lust for bodies. The suttas mention two main asubha practices; the first is going to a charnel ground to meditate on a decaying corpse, and the second is analysing the 31 parts of the body. Both of these practices cut through our idea of beauty by revealing loathsome and unattractive aspects of bodies whilst helping us see not-self, and reminding us of our very fragile mortality.

<p>Ticks. Mosquitoes. Flies.<br> 
Today in the forest<br> 
I am a feast for many.</p>

<article class="poem">
<p>Today 
the chilly shadows<br>
of the forest<br> 
seem to suit<br> 
my sombre mood.</p> 

<p>But stepping<br> 
into a patch<br> 
of glorious sunshine<br>
and feeling that sudden warmth—<br> 
Ahhh.</p>

<p>Life is good.<br> 
I am happy.</p>

<h3>Old</h3>

<p>Rubbing a salve into my aching joints<br>
My bones already<br> 
falling apart from the inside.</p>

<p><i>A skeleton puppet hemmed in by skin<br>
hanging together by threads.</i></p> 

<p>But not for long.</p>

<p>Remember that.</p>

<h3>Cold Sunset.</h3>

<p>Shivering in the forest<br> 
thinking: should I return?<br>
Return to the place of bones,<br> 
to look at them again.</p>

<p>To see.</p> 

<p>To make it real.</p>

<h3>Bones</h3>

<p>On the wet earth,<br> 
everywhere bones.<br> 
Bones of animal bones<br>
Bones of trees<br> 
all broken now and useless.</p> 

<p>And so it is. And so it is.</p>

<h3>Death Contemplation</h3>

<p>Sitting in the forest<br> 
looking at cow bones<br>
thinking about death.</p> 

<p>‘This body of mine. 
These bone of mine. 
I am just bones 
that will lie here, too,’ says the monk</p> 

<p>‘<i>Your</i> bones??’ says the tree deva watching,</p> 

<p>‘You think those bones belong to you?’</p>

<h3>Tree skeletons</h3>

<p>Bleached<br> 
bare branches.<br> 
The forest is full of bones<br>
of dead things.<br> 
I ask the fallen tree:<br>
<i>Did you live knowing that you would die?</i></p>

<p>Tree skeletons<br>

Skeleton trees?</p>

<h3>Revulsion</h3> 

<p>The swarming blackness<br> 
parts<br> 
to reveal<br> 
the source of this buzzing frenzy:<br> 
Ahh<br> 
a small lump of mouse flesh,<br>
purplish and rotting.<br> 
Grey hairs still visible</p>. 

<p>A feast for the flies;<br>
this foul nutriment.</p>

<h3>Black Stump</h3>
<p>Wretched body.<br> 
Soon you will become<br> 
like this blackened stump.</p> 

<p>Let go of the body!<br>
Do you really want this pissing,<br> 
shitting, ugly mess of suffering?<br> 
You think you can’t let go.<br>
that you can’t abandon it just yet?</p>

<p>But when the time comes,<br> 
do you really think you’ll even have a choice?</p>

<p>They will ready your body<br>
and calmly burn your bones.<br> 
Nothing left<br> 
but little black stumps in the ash.</p> 

<p>Blood and breath flesh and bones—<br> 
a slow disintegration followed by</p> 

<p>separation.</p>

<h3>Escape</h3>

<p>It’s all just fucking awful.<br> 
This world<br> 
this life.<br>
So, endure this base body<br> 
a little bit longer</p>

<p>Use it to get out.</p>

<h3>Pit Toilet in Summer</h3>

<p>I go to shit<br> 
in the scungy pit<br> 
and before I'd even finished<br>
a thousand flies<br></p> 

<P>are buzzing around my stinking arse—<br> 
feasting.</p> 

<p>They eat it all up<br> 
and then walk<br> 
that sticky shit<br> 
all over my arse cheeks.</p> 

<p>Then, zooming around<br> 
the hot, airless tin shack,<br> 
they come for my face.<br>
Rubbing my own shit in my eyes<br> 
as if to say: <i>See it? Do you see it, human?</i></p> 

<p>Shoving their filthy little feet<br> 
into the corners of my mouth<br>
with glee—<br>
<i>Here taste this, human!<br> 
You called it food before!</i></p>

<p>In the tight space<br> 
of that stinking hot shack<br>
the loathsome truth<br>
can’t be ignored—<br>
<i>Am I really so superior?</i></p> 

<p>The difference between<br> 
food and fertiliser<br>
is just a matter<br> 
of time.</p> 

<p>And soon my body<br>
will be food for flies.</p> 

<p>That’s why this world<br>
is nothing but<br> 
shit shit shit.<br> 
From start to finish,<br> 
You can’t avoid it.<br>
Shit.</p>

<h3>Practicing death</h3>

<p>This is how it will be<br>
at the end—<br> 
a fly<br> 
perched on your cheekbone<br>
feasting away<br> 
at the corner of your eye.</p>

<p> And you'll be lying there<br> 
with no blink<br> 
no twitch<br> 
to swoosh it away.<br>
Unable to lift<br> 
even a finger<br> 
to flick the hungry flies<br> 
mauling at your mouth.</p> 

<p>They'll drink your oozing fluids<br>
shit on your marbled skin.<br> 
Treat you like bloated buffet.</p> 

<p>There's nothing we can do<br> 
in the face of death.<br> 
But the flies will die too<br>
so don't begrudge them<br> 
their meal.</p>

<h3>Feeding</h3>

<p>Fucking flies!<br>
Fresh from rotting shit<br> 
they rub their filthy little paws<br> 
all over my body<br> 
pressing their horrid shit-filled mouths<br> 
on my lips—<br>
an unwanted kiss</p>

<p><i>Taste it!</i> 
The putrid flavour of the world.<br> 
Some nutriment!</p>

<h3>The Dumping Ground</h3>

<p>How now, dead cow?</p>

<p>Dumped<br>
with one swift kick<br> 
from the pick-up truck.<br>
The tyre tracks still visible<br>
speeding away<br> 
from the stench.</p>

<p>Your swollen yellow hoofs<br>
stick in the air.<br>
Dead eyes<br> 
face the sky.</p>

<p>Instead of tears<br>
Ants stream down your cheeks<br>
their bodies shine like jewels,<br> 
sparkling in the sun.<br>
Beautiful guests at a gruesome feast.</p>

<p>How now, dead cow?</p>

<p>Your ruddy red coat<br>
Bloated and stiff.<br>
Your poor neck<br>
twists at an unnatural angle.<br>
Head resting in the dust.<br>
I feel its sad, wasted weight.</p>

<p>From your gaping mouth<br> 
hangs a swollen purple tongue;<br>
a bridge for the invasion.<br> 
Now countless hungry ants<br> 
march upwards and onwards<br>
to feast from within.</p>

<p>How now, dead cow?</p>

<p>Was this a better end?<br> 
A dusty dumping ground<br> 
compared to the bleached floor<br> 
of an abattoir?</p> 

<p>At least here<br> 
you are amongst your ancestors.<br>
Your dead eyes cannot see, but<br> 
look, here a carcass rots beside you,<br>
from before you came.<br> 
And behind you<br> 
see the whitened bones of<br> 
earlier relatives.<br>
Long gone.</p> 

<p>But I am here.<br>
The alive one<br> 
who sees you.<br> 
Your death,<br>
your decay<br>
was not unwitnessed.<br>
For all that it matters.</p>

<p>How now, dead cow?</p>

<p>The smell of you<br> 
lingered on my body,<br>
all day,<br> 
attracting flies<br>
confused by the scent<br> 
of death.<br> 
Hungry for more.</p>

<p>How now, dead cow?</p><br>

<p>Half a year has passed<br>
The stench has gone,<br> 
your red coat has withered,<br> 
tufts of ruddy hair<br> 
stick up here and there.<br>
But now the emerald grass<br> 
has grown<br> 
and soon will hide<br> 
your white bones.</p> 

<p>Poor calf.<br>
Dead now, longer than<br>
you lived.</p>

<p>No marker for your grave.<br>
Yet it is here in this<br> 
sad and sorry place<br>
that the flowers<br> 
bloom the brightest.</p>
